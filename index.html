          <h2>Phishing Attacks</h2>
          <p>a type of attack using social engineering techniques in which cybercriminals impersonate legitimate entities to acquire personal and sensitive information or to infect users' devices with malware</p><br>
          <h2>Common ways of phishing attacks</h2>
              <p>(1.)Deceptive Phishing: Phishers impersonate legitimate entities through emails to obtain sensitive information like PII, banking details, and login credentials.</p>
              <p>(2.)Spear Phishing: Targeted attacks use personal information to craft messages that impersonate trusted contacts, urging specific individuals to disclose sensitive data.</p>
              <p>(3.)Watering Hole Phishing: Compromise frequently visited websites with malicious code, tricking users into downloading malware when they access these sites.</p>
              <p>(4.)Vishing: Phishing through phone calls where attackers use fake caller IDs or voice systems to extract personal information from victims.</p>
              <p>(5.)Smishing: Phishers send fraudulent SMS messages that mimic trusted sources, enticing users to click malicious links or reply with sensitive information.</p><br>
          
          <h2>Case study - spear phishing: fake job application</h2>
            <p>A recruitment officer was tricked into downloading a malicious file disguised as a resume, resulting in a More_eggs infection. This malware exploits a JavaScript backdoor known as More_eggs disguised as fake job applications. It has the ability to steal credentials from various accounts, including online banking, email, and IT administrator accounts</p>
        </div>
        <div class="security threats-item">
          <div class="icon"><img src="https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/02YJstK52KHDsoB72UaleBS-2..v1730140000.jpg" /></div>
          <h2>Malware</h2>
          <p>Operates by using deceptive tactics to disrupt the normal functioning of a device. After a cybercriminal gains access through various methods, they exploit this access to initiate further attacks, steal account credentials, gather personal information for sale, sell access to computing resources, or extort money from victims.</p><br>

          <h2>Common ways of Malware Attacks</h2>
              <p>(a.)Virus: A computer virus functions similarly to a biological virus in human bodies, replicating itself and spreading quickly by attaching to commonly used programs on a computer.</p>
              <p>(b.)Worm: Worms can also replicate and propagate, but they do so within their own containers and restrict their harmful activities to the specific application they infect.</p>
              <p>(c.)Botnet: Botnets are programs that infiltrate computers to create a network of compromised devices controlled by a central command server. These networks are often utilized to execute DDoS attacks.</p>
              <p>(d.)Ransomware: Ransomware locks the victim's computer, demanding payment to restore access. Its primary purpose is typically financial gain.</p><br>
              
          <h2>Case study - ransomware: WannaCry, 2017</h2>
            <p>The WannaCry ransomware attack was a significant security event that affected organizations globally such as FedEx and Honda. The cybercriminals behind the WannaCry attack exploited a vulnerability in the Microsoft Windows operating system, utilizing a hack known as EternalBlue, which was reportedly developed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA). EternalBlue was the primary exploit that enabled WannaCry's rapid propagation, with DoublePulsar serving as the backdoor installed on compromised systems to execute the ransomware. Many of the compromised computers remained encrypted and rendered unusable until the victims either paid the ransom or found a way to decrypt their data.</p>

          <h2>Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks</h2>
          <p>a cybersecurity threat where an unauthorized individual intercepts communication between two parties without their awareness, positioning themselves in the "middle" of the exchange. These attackers can eavesdrop on and alter the information being shared, enabling them to steal data and distribute malicious links while remaining unnoticed.</p><br>
          
          <h2>Common ways of MitM Attacks</h2>
              <p>(A.)Wi-Fi Eavesdropping: Attackers may create counterfeit Wi-Fi hotspots or infiltrate legitimate networks to capture user traffic.</p>
              <p>(B.)DNS Spoofing: By manipulating DNS records, which convert domain names into IP addresses, hackers can redirect users to harmful websites without their awareness.</p>
              <p>(C.)SSL Hijacking: Cybercriminals may intercept and alter SSL certificates, which secure the data exchanged between websites and users. This enables them to capture sensitive information, including login credentials and credit card details.</p><br>
             
            <h2>Case study of SSL Hijacking: Equifax Data Breach</h2>
            <p>In September 2017, Equifax, one of the three largest credit reporting agencies in the United States, revealed that its systems had been compromised, resulting in the exposure of sensitive personal information belonging to 148 million Americans. This resulted in the credit card details of around 209,000 consumers being affected. The roots of the Equifax incident can be traced back to a significant vulnerability discovered in the open-source web application framework Apache Struts. This framework, which was deeply integrated into Equifax's operations, became the initial entry point for the attack.</p>
